HandyJson
=========

HandyJson is a very easy to use single class to parse / build JSON data.




Parsing JSON and Building JSON data tests are in main.cpp.


Next version will contain :
- More c++ types such as std::string
- Operators overload such as [] for arrays and objects, = for duplicates and maybe others
